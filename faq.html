                We get mixed reviews on pain. Everyone has a 
                        different level of sensitivity so topical 
                        anesthetics are applied before and during the 
                        treatment to alleviate any sensation or 
                        discomfort. Some clients naturally feel one 
                        brow sorer than the other. You will hear a 
                        scratch noise/ sensation throughout.

                Most likely. Within a week of your first 
                treatment the color will fade significantly 
                 and over the next four to six weeks can 
                 continue to fade as much as 50%. This is 
                considered an extremely positive occurrence 
                  as it allows you time to reflect on your shape
               and color. After this period your follow-up 
                appointment is carried out. At this point any 
                 changes you would like to make are discussed.

                Because color is implanted in the 
                        facial area there tends to be more fluid
                         circulation than other parts of the body.
                          Your face sees the most wear of any piece
                           of you—exposure to the sun, food, facial
                            products—the list goes on and on. All of
                             these things cause permanent color to 
                             fade, this is why you need a touch up.

                The procedure takes roughly about 2-3 hours,

                          a solid 4-hour window for your appointment.
                           I likely won’t need that much time, but this

                No. There’s no downtime associated with the
                         treatment. Redness and swelling will dissipate
                          within an hour after. Your brows will appear
                           darker initially, but not so dark that you
                            will be prevented from your activities of

                Healing time varies from individual to 
                        individual. Usually, it takes about a 
                        week to ten days for the epithelial crust
                         to form and slough off. Your skin will be
                          considered healed after that happens. Then,
                           the pigment takes some time to settle into
                            the skin. A good month should pass before 
                            I consider the process complete.

                What’s the process like?
              </label>
              <div class="answers">
                Eyebrow tattoo is a two-step treatment, 
                        consisting of an initial procedure and 
                        then a touch up between 6-8 weeks after.
                        After taking your before photo, I will draw 
                        the brow design in pencil so you get an idea 
                        of shape and form. (Please note that nobody’s 
                        face is totally symmetrical and you need to be
                         realistic with your expectations. There is no 
                         point in trying to make the eyebrows identical
                          or match a photo of your favorite celebrities'
                           eyebrows if your face shape looks nothing 
                           like theirs.). Once we have agreed on a 
                           final shape (ultimately it is your decision
                            – but I will always voice my opinion on 
                            what I think suits you aesthetically), I
                             will shape your eyebrows then we will 
                             decide on the color. Shortly after that, 
                             a topical anesthetic will be administered 
                             to ensure comfort. Once you’re numb, the 
                             pigment is deposited. During healing, 
                             it's normal to experience some pigment 
                             loss; this is why we have the touch up 
                             in place.

                You are advised to keep the skin clean and

                         peeling, scratching or rubbing the tattoo,
                          this may result in a loss of color and 
                          scarring. You can still wash your hair and
                           face and once they’re healed up, you treat

                client has the opportunity to return and I 
                get the chance to review the work and sort 
                out any (if any) tweaks that might need to 
                be done. Often times the clients cancel this
                 apt as all is usually well, however there 
                 are the occasional few that may need one or 
                 two extra strokes to finish off the look. 
                 Some ladies skin may react to the trauma of 
                 the tattooing, and the skin may try to push
                  out the foreign body of pigment by producing
                   an extreme scab, so they eventually fall off
                    taking all the pigment with it. There is a
                     condition called Pigment Allergy 
                     (PPD Allergy, a condition known by 
                     dermatologists) or Auto Immune disease 
                     symptoms (the client may not even be 
                     aware of it). The skin would have over 
                     reacted and become super sensitive to 
                     the pigment and reject it at any cost.

                Unfortunately, I can't. How the skin will 
                        react is different for everyone and many factors
                         are to be taken into consideration. Skin type,
                          age, scarring, diet, stress levels, facial 
                          products used, etc. all play a key role in 
                          how the pigment will hold, which is why it is
                           important to know that more than one touch 
                           up may be required. I can guarantee that your face is important
                           to me and that I will act in accordance 
                           with my experience and expertise to give 
                           you my absolute best. I can guarantee that
                            I will strive to make you gratified and 
                            content every time. But there are no 
                            guarantees in this industry. Please think
                             long and hard before you decide to go for
                              it.

                Although Microblading is considered to be 
                        semi-permanent, the procedure does allow 
                        flexibility for color or shape change to 
                        some extent. However, I will work closely 
                        with you to ensure that you are satisfied 
                        with the proposed technique. I will allow 
                        you to have as much control over the procedure
                         as possible, so there’s very little room 
                         for error. If you do not like the decision 
                         you made, the Touch Up can be cancelled and
                          the pigmented area naturally fades away over
                           time. If you aren’t 100% sure you would 
                           benefit from this procedure, please opt 
                           for a more temporary option.
